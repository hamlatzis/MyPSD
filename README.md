# MyPSD
A generic class to import Adobe's Photoshop (.psd) images


One of my early works. 

* [Original post](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/10398/Import-Adobe-Photoshop-psd-images)
* Later on when experimenting with early mobile devices converted the code to run under [PocketPC Windows Mobile 2003](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/15739/PSD-for-PocketPC-Windows-Mobile-2003)
* [Has been ported by others](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/10885/Reading-Adobe-Photoshop-images)
* Is used in the [CxImage library](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1300/CxImage)
